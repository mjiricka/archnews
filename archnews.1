Options \fB\-\-since\fR, \fB\-\-grep\fR and \fB\-\-num-news\fR
are filters. It means they can filter news according certain criterion. These filters
can be combined (e.g. use \fB\-\-grep\fR together with \fB\-\-num-news\fR),
but \fB\-\-num-news\fR will be always applied as the last filter.


.SH FILES

.IX Header "FILES"
.IP "\fIhttps://www.archlinux.org/feeds/news/\fR"
.IX Item "https://www.archlinux.org/feeds/news/"
URL of the source RSS feed.

.IP "\fI$XDG_DATA_HOME/archnews/unread\fR"
.IX Item "$XDG_DATA_HOME/archnews/unread"

only when option \fB\-\-unread\fR is used. If no \fB$XDG_DATA_HOME\fR is set, then
\fI'~/.local/share/\fR is used.


.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP \fBLOCALE\fR

.SH RETURN CODES
.IP \fB0\fR
Everything went well and some news were shown.
.IP \fB1\fR
Everything went well but no news were shown.
.IP \fB2\fR
Error in parameters.
.IP \fB3\fR
Runtime error occured, e.g. feed cannot be fetched.


.SH PACMAN WRAPPER
\fBarchnews\fR comes with a wrapper for \fBpacman\fR called
\fBarchnews_wrap\fR, that runs \fBarchnews\fR when upgrading the system
(\fBpacman -Syu\fR).  The wrapper runs \fBarchnews\fR script with
\fB--unread\fR option, so one will never miss a news when doing dist-upgrade!

All what is needed to do is to have these two aliases:
.RS
.nf
\fBalias sudo='sudo '\fR  # This enables aliases for commands inside sudo.
\fBalias pacman=archnews_wrap\fR  # This invokes wrapper whenever pacman is called.
.fi
.RE
The first invocation will list all news in feed. Further invocations will
display only unread messages. (Of course info about unread messages is stored
inside user's home directory, it is not system-wide!)


.SH BUGS
Probably some. Would be great if you report them!
